	description = No longer are you limited to research facilities only on Kerbin!  With the Mobile Processing Lab, you can conduct long-term experiments and ongoing research with the data you collect in the field.  Be sure to check back on your scientists from time to time, and transmit the results of their research home! This model is the junior budget version, designed to fit in a Mk2 fuselage, and also has the equipment necessary to clean out and restore functionality to inoperable experiments.
