description = A Mk2 fuselage mounted heavy-duty electric generator for when fuelcells just simply aren't enough to meet a vessel's power requirements. This unit fills the middle ground between fuelcells and nuclear reactors, producing more power than the former without the eight and cost of the latter. Like its smaller bretheren, this unit uses LiquidFuel/Oxidizer to produce power, but unlike them, it can alsouse  raw Ore, though at reduced efficiency.
