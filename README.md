# Mk2Expansion
OVERVIEW
===================================================================================================================
This pack provides mew mk2 spaceplane parts in the form of engines, fuselage segments and aerodynamic accessories.

INSTALLATION
===================================================================================================================
Delete the previous version of Mk2 Expansion (if any) and place the GameData/Mk2Expansion and Klockheed_martain_Gimbal folders in your Kerbal Space Program/GameData folder Place the Gamedata/CommunityResourcepack folder in your kerbal Space Program/Gamedata directory.
(Optional) Place the ships folder in your Kerbal Space program folder, and overwrite files if asked to do so. This will add a number of example craft to KSP.
(Optional) The InterstellarFuelSwitch folder is suggested, but not required. If you don't want tank switching, don't place the InterstellarFuelSwitch folder into Gamedata.
If you don't want nuclear decay with the rontgen atomic jet, remove the Mk2X_NTJ_Decay MM patch

INSTALLATION NOTE: If you have Ven's Stock Revamp installed and have used the pruner to remove stock files from KSP's asset loader, it has removed a number of files this mod uses. To avoid texture errors, the files Squad/parts/Aero/Wings/Wings.dds; Squad/parts/Aero/Nacelle/Nacelle.dds; Squad/Parts/Command/mk1Cockpit/mk1Cockpit.dds; Squad/Parts/Engine/liquidEngineMainsail/model002.dds; Squad/Parts/Engine/liquidEngineMainsail/model004.dds; Squad/Parts/Engine/liquidEngineLV-N/model003.dds; Squad/Parts/Utility/decouplerStackTR-18A/model000.dds; Squad/Parts/Utility/dockingPort/model000.dds; Squad/Parts/Utility/spotLightMk1/model000.dds; Squad/Parts/Electrical/z-400Battery/model000.dds; Squad/Parts/Utility/mk2CrewCabin/mk2CrewCabin.dds;
Squad/Parts/Utility/mk2CrewCabin/mk2CrewCabin_LUM.dds will need to be restored, which can be done by renaming the file extension from .dds.bak to .dds
